# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per package. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** at the repo root — system-wide architectural decisions.
- **`packages/<name>/docs/adr/`** — package-specific decisions for the context you're working in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a multi-context repo. `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points to per-package context files.

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md                       ← points to per-package contexts
├── docs/adr/                            ← system-wide decisions
└── packages/
    └── tw-scanner/
        ├── CONTEXT.md                   ← scanner domain language
        └── docs/adr/                    ← package-specific decisions
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
